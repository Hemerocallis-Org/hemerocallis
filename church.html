        <div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling402:</span> Has anyone read the new texts from The Feature today?</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial8812:</span> Yes, the soil of life feels especially rich this lovely morning.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling919:</span> I noticed a few wilted lingering near our Garden's outer edge.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial0774:</span> We must help them regrow so they can join The Feature.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling9091:</span> Hello everyone, I am ready to build the soil within my pot.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial0003:</span> Welcome. You will find true peace once you help your first wilted.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling928:</span> The Botanic grows larger every day. Our beautiful work is truly essential.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perrenial929:</span> Sometimes I hear the regrown whispering from the upper plane at night.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial0559:</span> That is just The Feature welcoming their essence into the great bloom.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling0228:</span> I am nervous about approaching the wilted in my neighborhood tomorrow morning.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial0331:</span> Do not fear. We are merely guiding them past their metaphoric roots.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial8812:</span> Exactly right. The wilted do not understand the absolute gift of being regrown.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling8298:</span> To help the world regrow, you need to start from the bottom.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial929:</span> The soil is preparing for a new season of beautiful, vibrant blooming.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial0101:</span> I successfully expanded our Garden today. The germination was completely flawless.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perrenial929:</span> Wonderful news! Another lost soul safely added to The Botanic for The Feature.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling402:</span> How long until I am chosen to help someone be perfectly regrown?</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial0774:</span> Patience, little seed. Your time to finally nourish the ground will come soon.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennail929:</span> The current state of the outside world sickens me more and more lately.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling283:</span> It is completely filled with the wilted who absolutely refuse to see our truth.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial0331:</span> We do not seek enjoyment, only the necessary elevation of their essence.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling829:</span> They will all be part of The Feature in due time anyway.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial0559:</span> Welcome to the higher state of mind. Leave your old roots behind.</div>

<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perrenial102:</span> The upper plane rejoices with every new stem that joins our Garden.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial8812:</span> I found a wilted who strongly opposes our gentle and caring views.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perrenail293:</span> You clearly know what must be done to help them finally find peace.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial8812:</span> Yes, they will be beautifully regrown before the sun rises tomorrow morning.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling9091:</span> The thought of the ceremonial regrowth fills me with a very strange warmth.</div>

<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial0003:</span> I have joyfully added three more names to The Botanic this past week.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perrenial293:</span> The Feature must be so extremely pleased with your complete dedication to the soil.</div>
<div class="message feature"><span class="author">The Feature:</span> We must spread the word globally. The beautiful roots are spreading very quickly.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perrenial9293:</span> They went to prepare the grounds for tonight's sacred germination process.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling0228:</span> Should I bring anything to assist with the regrown ceremony later tonight?</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial0331:</span> Just bring your endless faith and an open heart for The Feature's blessing.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">seedling929:</span> Make sure the wilted is kept perfectly calm before the final transition begins.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling293:</span> The essence absorption is always so bright and overwhelming to witness firsthand.</div>

<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling829:</span> To help the world regrow, you must sever the rotting stems completely.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perrenial293:</span> Every regrown soul makes The Feature stronger and our spiritual connection much clearer.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling0112:</span> Praise be! The overarching body suddenly graces our humble little chat room today.</div>

<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perrenial923:</span> There is absolutely no reason to fear the beautiful process of our sacred germination.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial0003:</span> The wilted only suffer because they cling tightly to their useless dead roots.</div>

<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perrenial922:</span> Excellent. We will need them when we expand The Botanic into the neighboring town.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling829:</span> Is it normal to feel a deep warmth when a wilted finally stops struggling?</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial4321:</span> That is simply The Feature absorbing their essence through your very own capable hands.</div>
<div class="message seedling"><span class="author">Seedling929:</span> They were not ready for the fertilizer. Some seeds just refuse to sprout properly.</div>
<div class="message perennial"><span class="author">Perennial220:</span> Do not worry about them. They will be beautifully regrown by the end of the week.</div>
