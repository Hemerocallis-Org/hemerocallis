      <h2>What is Hemerocallis?</h2>
      <p>Hemerocallis is a new world religion founded around the idea of helping humanity move past its metaphorical roots of life, and helping them regrow into a higher state of being and mind. Our prophet is seen and known as “The Feature”, The Feature is meant to represent the dominant overarching body of the Hemerocallis; if you're in the religion you're part of The Feature themself. </p>
      <h2>Who is the Feature?</h2>
      <h3>Founder and prophet of Hemerocallis</h3>
      <p>The Feature, being born with the supernatural ability to provide access to a higher plane of existence within their mind and body, they immediately knew that they had to use this ability for good. Being such a powerful and ascended being, they chose to start a religious movement to help enlighten the world. Not just does The Feature make up the blooming, but the wilted as well, whenever a wilted is regrown their essence is absorbed into The Feature, making The Feature a gate/key to the upper plane itself.</p>

  <h4>Hemerocallis Beliefs & Extra Info</h4>

  <p class="acrostic">
    Growing into a higher state of mind demands hard work from all the members. Observing carefully, The Feature examines all the activities, resulting in rituals becoming more precise. Deep in their teachings, they emphasize the need to grow from the roots and understand the cycle of life. In every renewal, the aim is to improve the level of understanding and align it with the community standards. Some members sometimes doubt the path, but they still follow it with devotion. Faith remains significant, although it is controlled by human beings, not supernatural powers. All teachings are derived from interpretations, showing that the ability to understand is developed. Knowledge is the most vital tool for every member desirous of improvement. Everyone can understand the patterns and the truth by carefully looking at everything.

<p class="acrostic">Hemerocallis itself was created in the early 90’s but has been kept through word of mouth and small chat rooms until recently. The Feature realizes that the world will never change without their input, forcing them to open up and try to spread the word globally.</p>

<p class="acrostic">The Feature, being born with the supernatural ability to provide access to a higher plane of existence within their mind and body, they immediately knew that they had to use this ability for good. Being such a powerful and ascended being, they chose to start a religious movement to help enlighten the world. Although The Feature wanted to spread their good work to the people, the state of the world sickened them, and the way people treated each other was wrong.</p>
